I guess you're reading me.
The idea was to make a nice litte game that's not about getting anything more than the fun of doing it.
After spending the week very plugged into the computer I'm simaltaniously having difficulty not being 
on a screen and very much in need of something relaxing, so for my little project I made this meditative
scroller box thing over a picure I took of some nice fireflys.
Plus my name and a link just to show I could.
